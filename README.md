## Interview Questions

This GitHub repository contains various programming challenges aimed to give users practice at common C style interview questions. These are language agnostic questions but this repository uses C# because of the fast compilation times and extensive IDE's/tools.

### Question 1
Implement a linked list. Test if there is a loop in the linked list. Fix a loop in the linked list. Convert the linked list to an array. Reverse a linked list.

### Question 2
Implement a binary search tree. Perform inorder, preorder and postorder traversals on it.

### Question 3
Given an array of integers. Find the largest increasing subsequence of integers in the array

### Question 4
Divide two integers without using multiplication, division or the mod operator.

### Question 5
How many times will a robot need to retrieve bins if it is given an array of bin ID's and it can only hold N bins at a time? When the robot is already holding N bins, it will return the least recently retrieved bin and store the new bin.  

### Question 6
Given an array of unique integers, return a pair of integers that sum up to a target sum. 

### Question 7
Given a 2D maze, find the way from top-left corner to bottom-right corner. 

### Question 8
Implement the heap sort algorithm.
