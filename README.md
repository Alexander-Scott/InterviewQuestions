## Interview Questions

This GitHub repository contains various programming challenges aimed to give users practice at common C style interview questions. These are language agnostic questions but this repository uses C# because of the fast compilation times and extensive IDE's/tools.

### Question 1
Implement a linked list. Test if there is a loop in the linked list. Fix a loop in the linked list. Convert the linked list to an array. Reverse a linked list.

### Question 2
Implement a binary search tree. Perform inorder, preorder and postorder traversals on it.

### Question 3
Given an array of integers. Find the largest increasing subsequence of integers in the array

### Question 4
Divide two integers without using multiplication, division or the mod operator.

### Question 5
How many times will a robot need to retrieve bins if it is given an array of bin ID's and it can only hold N bins at a time? When the robot is already holding N bins, it will return the least recently retrieved bin and store the new bin.  

### Question 6
Given an array of unique integers, return the smallest sum of two indexes whos values add up to a target number. 

### Question 7
Starting with a 1-indexed array of zeros and a list of operations, for each operation add a value to each of the array element between two given indices, inclusive. Once all operations have been performed, return the maximum value in the array.

### Question 8
Consider an undirected graph consisting of n nodes where each node is labeled from 1 to n and the edge between any two nodes is always of length 6. We define node s to be the starting position for a BFS. Given a graph, determine the distances from the start node to each of its descendants and return the list in node number order, ascending. If a node is disconnected, it's distance should be -1.

### Question 9
Given a 2D maze, find the way from top-left corner to bottom-right corner. 

### Question 10
Implement the heap sort algorithm.
